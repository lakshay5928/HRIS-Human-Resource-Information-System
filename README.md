## 🌟 Overview

The **Human Resource Information System (HRIS)** is a comprehensive, web-based solution designed to streamline and automate core HR processes within an organization. It provides a centralized platform for managing employee data, tracking time and attendance, administering benefits, and facilitating efficient communication between HR staff, managers, and employees.

This system aims to improve HR operational efficiency, reduce administrative burden, and provide data-driven insights for strategic decision-making.

## 🚀 Key Features

This HRIS project is designed to cover the fundamental pillars of human resource management:

* **Employee Data Management:** Centralized database for all employee records, including personal information, contact details, employment history, and documents.
* **Time & Attendance Tracking:** Features for logging work hours, managing shifts, and tracking absences (vacation, sick leave, etc.).
* **Leave Management:** Employee self-service portal to request and track time off, with automated manager approval workflows.
* **Payroll Integration (Optional):** Foundation for integrating with payroll systems to ensure accurate and timely compensation processing. `[TODO: Mention if it includes payroll or is integrated with one]`
* **User Roles & Permissions:** Distinct user roles (Admin, Manager, Employee) to ensure secure and appropriate access to sensitive data.
* **Reporting & Analytics:** Generate reports on key HR metrics such as turnover, attendance, and departmental structure.
* **Self-Service Portal:** Employees can view payslips, update personal information, and request time off without HR intervention.

## 📦 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your local copy of the HRIS up and running.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your machine:

* `[TODO: Software 1, e.g., Node.js]` (`[TODO: Min. Version, e.g., 16.x]`)
* `[TODO: Software 2, e.g., Python]` (`[TODO: Min. Version, e.g., 3.10]`)
* `[TODO: Software 3, e.g., Git]`
* `[TODO: Software 4, e.g., Database Server (e.g., PostgreSQL)]`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/lakshay5928/HRIS-Human-Resource-Information-System.git](https://github.com/lakshay5928/HRIS-Human-Resource-Information-System.git)
    cd HRIS-Human-Resource-Information-System
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    * **Backend:**
        ```bash
        [TODO: Command to install backend dependencies, e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt or composer install]
        ```
    * **Frontend:**
        ```bash
        [TODO: Command to install frontend dependencies, e.g., npm install or yarn install]
        ```

3.  **Database and Environment Setup**
    * Create a copy of the environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    * Open the `.env` file and configure your database connection details and any necessary API keys. `[TODO: Specify which variables need to be set, e.g., DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD]`
    * Run database migrations and seeding:
        ```bash
        [TODO: Command to run migrations, e.g., python manage.py migrate]
        [TODO: Command to seed database with initial data, e.g., python manage.py loaddata initial_data]
        ```

## 🏃 Running the Application

Start the development servers for both the backend API and the frontend client.

1.  **Start the Backend Server**
    ```bash
    [TODO: Command to start the backend, e.g., npm run start-api or php artisan serve]
    ```
    The API should be running at `http://localhost:[TODO: PORT, e.g., 8000]`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Client**
    ```bash
    [TODO: Command to start the frontend, e.g., npm run dev or yarn serve]
    ```
    The application should be accessible at `http://localhost:[TODO: PORT, e.g., 3000]`.

3.  **Default Credentials**
